Hello everyone 

DocuBot is an advanced medical chatbot that uses cutting-edge Machine Learning (ML) and Neural Network (NN) technologies 
to provide patients with accurate and personalized information about Arthritis. Its first version is specifically designed 
to address the needs of patients with Arthritis, providing them with real-time support and guidance on managing their condition.

DocuBot is equipped with a vast knowledge base that contains comprehensive information about Arthritis, including causes, symptoms, 
types of Arthritis, and risk factors.

With DocuBot, patients can access information about Arthritis at any time, from anywhere, using simple and intuitive chat-based interactions.
The chatbot is designed to be user-friendly and can understand natural language, making it easy for patients to ask questions and get the answers they need.

DocuBot's design was built using Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), a Python library for natural language processing. NLTK's tools enable DocuBot to understand and 
interpret human language.

Overall, DocuBot represents a major advance in the field of healthcare, leveraging the power of ML and NN technologies to deliver personalized, real-time support to
patients with Arthritis. With its sophisticated algorithms and vast knowledge base, DocuBot has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach the treatment and
